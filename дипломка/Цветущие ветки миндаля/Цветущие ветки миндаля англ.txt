“Flowering Almond Branches” is a painting of the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, painted by him in Saint-Remy-de-Provence in 1890. On January 31, 1890, Theo van Gogh wrote to Vincent about the birth of a son, who was named Vincent Willem in honor of his uncle. Vincent van Gogh immediately set to work on a painting that he intended to give to his younger brother. As conceived by Vincent, the canvas was to hang over the spouses' bed and symbolize the beginning of a new life. This justifies the choice of the plot of the canvas - almond branches begin to bloom very early and are harbingers of spring.
