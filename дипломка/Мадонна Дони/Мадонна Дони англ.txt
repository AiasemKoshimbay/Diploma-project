"Madonna Doni" - the only extant easel work of Michelangelo Buonarroti that has survived to our time. It is a tondo 120 cm in diameter with the image of the Holy Family; exhibited in the Uffizi. Tondo was executed by Michelangelo in 1504. The painting perfectly illustrates Michelangelo's thesis that the most perfect painting is one that resembles sculpture. The intricate convolutions of human flesh evoke the ancient sculptural group Laocoon and His Sons, discovered in 1506.
