"The Ninth Wave" - one of the most famous paintings by Russian artist Ivan Aivazovsky, is stored in the Russian Museum in St. Petersburg. It was written in 1850.
The painter depicts the sea after a very strong night storm and shipwrecked people. The rays of the sun illuminate the huge waves. The largest of them - the ninth rampart - is ready to fall upon people,
Â  trying to escape on the wreckage of a mast.
